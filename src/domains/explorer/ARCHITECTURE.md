# Explorer Architecture

## Responsibilities

- `components/ExplorerTree.vue` orchestrates the explorer UI shell, tree focus,
  filtering, context menus, keyboard routing, and drag-and-drop provider.
- `components/ExplorerItem.vue` renders a single visible row and wires the
  row-level drag/drop refs onto the existing markup.
- `composables/useExplorerTreeState.ts` owns loaded tree snapshots, expansion
  state, visible-row derivation, and reveal-in-view behavior.
- `composables/useExplorerOperations.ts` owns explorer mutations and prompts.
  Drag and drop delegates final moves here instead of touching the filesystem
  directly.
- `composables/useExplorerDnD.ts` owns drag state, current drop target
  resolution, click suppression after drops, and translation from hover state
  to explorer move intents.
- `lib/explorerDndRules.ts` keeps DnD validation pure and testable.

## Drag And Drop MVP

- Library: `@vue-dnd-kit/core@2.2.0`.
- Scope: move files, folders, and normalized multi-selection within the visible
  explorer tree.
- Supported intents:
  - `inside` drops on folders move the dragged entries into that folder.
  - `before` / `after` drops on visible rows only target that row's parent
    directory. They do not create a persistent sort order.
- Unsupported in MVP:
  - drag-copy with modifier keys,
  - external file import,
  - dedicated keyboard drag-and-drop workflow,
  - filtered-tree drag and drop.

## Validation Rules

- Drag and drop is disabled while a filter query is active because filtered rows
  do not represent the full structural context of the workspace tree.
- A row in inline rename mode is neither draggable nor droppable.
- Multi-selection is normalized before move so descendants already covered by a
  selected parent are not moved twice.
- Invalid targets are rejected before invoking explorer operations:
  - moving a folder into itself,
  - moving a folder into one of its descendants,
  - `before` / `after` drops that would stay in the same parent and therefore
    have no effect under the explorer's alphabetical sort.

## Interaction Notes

- Drag activation uses a movement threshold so click, double-click, context
  actions, folder toggle, and inline rename remain the primary interactions.
- Starting a drag on an unselected row promotes that row to the active
  selection. Starting from a selected row moves the normalized selection.
- Folder moves reuse the existing confirmation prompt and name-conflict flow
  from `useExplorerOperations.ts`.
